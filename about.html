      <h2>Some informations</h2>
      <p>
        Electronic sports, also called with the English abbreviation esport,
        e-sport or eSport (from electronic sports), are competitive and
        professional level video game competitions. The games that are part of
        it are usually multiplayer, although it is also possible to compete
        with single-player games, trying to get the highest score. They are
        played competitively at an amateur, semi-professional and professional
        level, and their championships and tournaments are organized, both
        online and live. <br>
        Live tournaments are organized like any other sporting event, with
        referees and commentators specialized in each specific game, while the
        qualifying phases are often held with players connected remotely via
        network platforms. Among the best known international competitions are
        the World Cyber Games, the Electronic Sports World Cup, the
        DreamHack and the various annual tournaments organized by ESL
        (originally Electronic Sports League) and MLG (Major League Gaming).

        The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game
        Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an "Intergalactic spacewar olympics" whose grand prize was a year's
        subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament and Tovar and
        Robert E. Maas winning the team competition. <br>
        Contemporary esports has roots in competitive face-to-face arcade video game competitions. A forerunner of
        esports was held by Sega in 1974, the All Japan TV Game Championships, a nationwide arcade video game tournament
        in Japan. The tournament was intended by Sega to promote the play and sales of video games in the
        country. There were local tournaments held in 300 locations across Japan, and then sixteen finalists from across
        the country competed in the final elimination rounds at Tokyo's Hotel Pacific. Prizes awarded included
        television sets (color and black-and-white), cassette tape recorders and transistor radios.

        The golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito's Space Invaders in 1978, which popularized the use
        of a persistent high score for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding
        other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players' initials in games
        like Asteroids in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition. <br>
        The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition,
        attracting more
        than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby.
        Walter Day, owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record
        the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded Twin Galaxies, a high score record-keeping
        organization.

        The fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition
        between two players.Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player,
        but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead challenge each other directly,
        "face-to-face," to determine the best player, paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch
        modes found in modern action games. <br>
        The popularity of fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs.
        Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports
        tournament in 1996. Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which
        toured across the
        United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California.

        The growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of broadband
        Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment
        rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work. <br>
        Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet caf√©/LAN
        gaming center, known as a PC
        bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in
        2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country.
        Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Park Jie-won coined the term "Esports" at the founding ceremony of the
        21st Century Professional Game Association (currently
        Korean e-Sports Association) in 2000.

        In 2013, the Season 3 League of Legends World Championship was held in a sold-out Staples
        Center. The 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had over 40,000 fans in
        attendance and featured the band Imagine Dragons, and opening and closing ceremonies in addition to the
        competition. <br>
        In 2015, the first Esports Arena was launched in Santa Ana, California, as the United States' first dedicated
        esports facility. <br>
        In 2021, China announced a law which forbade minors from playing video games, which they described as "spiritual
        opium", for more than three hours a week. With China being a large market, the law raised concerns about the
        future of esports within the country.
