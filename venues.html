                    <h2>Italy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The growth prospects are good and as the eSport 2019 report, presented in Milan by Aesvi
                        (Association of Italian Italian Video Game Developers Association) and Nielsen, this new video
                        game phenomenon is attracting a large audience of gamers. <br>
                        Approximately 350,000 gamers are actively involved in esports events in our country and over one
                        million are those who claim to follow these types of events. Unfortunately, these numbers
                        have not yet woken up the institutions, which still see video games as something
                        dedicated to children and teenagers locked away in their bedrooms. A problem of mentality
                        that risks preventing esports stadium projects from taking off in our country. <br>
                        To take the field, first and foremost, are companies and football teams that have
                        formed multi-gaming teams, which participate in self-regulated competitions. Surely soon
                        soon we will see the first esports arenas capable of concentrating a large number of
                        gamers, and an early example was the PG nationals finals, where the
                        Olimpico turned into a mini esports stadium. While waiting to see how the Lega Calcio Serie
                        A will make its first official and serious move into the world of esports.

                        The country that first realised the importance of this phenomenon was South Korea, to the point
                        that in 2000 the KeSpa, an acronym for the Korean e-Sports Association, was founded by order of
                        the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. <br>
                        Tourism, the KeSpa, acronym for Korean e-Sports Association, with the task of regulating and
                        promote this new gaming phenomenon. Obviously, in addition to Korean institutions, even
                        the big media understood the importance, in terms of audience, of esports to the point of
                        dedicating two satellite channels broadcasting matches and gameplay 24 hours a day. The bedroom
                        had by then small for Korean kids and the first esports stadiums appeared. The Busan
                        Bexco Stadium and Haeundae Beach welcome thousands of fans creating atmospheres equal to
                        those of a sports stadium.

                        In the world of esports stadiums, the last months of 2017 were crucial for the start-up of the
                        first made-in-China project. The Zhongxian E-Sports Stadium, located in Chingqing in western
                        China
                        western China, will be entirely dedicated to e-sports events, presenting some
                        mind-boggling numbers. <br>
                        With a total capacity of 20,000 seats, of which 7,000 will be seated, thanks to special glass
                        walls
                        glass walls on which LED screens will be installed, it will transform the entire esports stadium
                        into a
                        gigantic screen that will project outside, everything that happens inside the arena
                        game arena. The Zhongxian E-Sports Stadium represents one part of a project under development.
                        In the vicinity of the arena will be an accommodation facility dedicated specifically to young
                        esports talents, as well as an actual hotel. <br>
                        After Chingqing, another member of the esports stadium roster is about to arrive in Shanghai's
                        Minhang district.
                        roster of esports stadiums. The project is a collaboration between the local authorities and
                        Tencent, company owner of the League of Legends brand, will see the creation of an esports
                        stadium
                        within a district dedicated to the development of video games and television productions.
                        The arena, planned with a capacity of 5000 people, will be the meeting point of the
                        neo-gaming district

                        The United States did not sit idly by and, confident of replicating the success of the
                        success, they too began to build their first esports stadiums.
                        esports stadiums. Dallas is home to the largest esports stadium in America, which has made
                        reborn Arlington Convention Center. Costing $10 million, it covers an area of
                        9000 square metres and has a seating capacity of 3000. <br>
                        Philadelphia will witness the birth of the Fusion Arena in 2021. The construction of
                        this new example of esports stadiums, was desired by the Philadelphia Fusion, an active team
                        of the Overwatch League, and will host the team's home matches. This arena, although
                        not yet operational, has the potential to become the alpha in architectural and
                        functional. A $50 million project that will also host other types
                        of events, in addition to esports, will provide 3500 seats and infrastructure
                        technologically advanced infrastructure. <br>

                        spectators and 40 gaming stations, is entirely dedicated to competitive gaming, becoming
                        the focal point of city and even area events.

                    <p>
                        Europe, too, did not just sit back and watch and, studying the best practices of other countries
                        foreign countries, has begun to take its first steps into the world of esports stadiums. In the
                        heart of
                        London you will find the Red Bull Gaming Sphere, the largest esports stadium in the UK.
                        Technologically advanced, it is a multi-purpose space where sportsmen and women can train with
                        all the major titles of the moment, using the different equipped areas.
                        In Spain, an aircraft carrier called Real Madrid has moved in. The blancos have winked at the
                        world of esports stadiums and rumours see the announcement of their official team very close.
                        official. Obviously Real likes to do things big and inside the new Santiago
                        Bernabeu there will be a space entirely dedicated to the world of electronic games.
                        The project has been put on paper, both in terms of cost and timing. There is talk of an
                        esports stadium, or more precisely, an arena located inside the new stadium of Real
                        Madrid stadium, equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The construction costs of the new
                        stadium are
                        Real: from the 400 million budgeted in 2014 to the current 525 million, to be paid back in
                        35 years at 25 million per year, largely covered by the expected revenue of 150 million. For
                        whether all this will come true, we have to wait until 2022.
