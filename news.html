            Riot reveals League exclusive recall for players who reach Honor 5
          </h2>
          <p>
            Earlier this year, the Riot devs unveiled they wanted to make the
            behavioral system in League of Legends "matter more" by building
            solutions that "directly impact" the players, like giving out
            rewards based on the honor system.
            <br />
            One of the rewards that is set to be given out to honorable players
            is a special recall animation. The video of this new animation was
            shared today on Twitter by Kristy Doan, a VFX artist for League, who
            also hinted at a possible new Challenger recall.

            Fortnite no build tournament - first build free tournament in-game
          </h2>
          <p>
            Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 2 has launched in the game recently,
            bringing the usual wave of new additions to the game. However, one
            big change came with the new season, Epic vaulted building. Building
            has been removed from the game, at least temporarily. Building is
            definitely going to make a return to the game, but for now, Fortnite
            is playing like any other shooter.
            <br />
            While the builds are still active in the competitive mode of the
            game, we've gotten our first Fortnite no build tournament.

          <h2>VALORANT blog teases newest agent</h2>
          <p>
            In the State of the Agents blog posted by Riot Games, they talked a
            little about the upcoming agent. One of the key factors that was
            discussed was the agent revolving around gathering information,
            alongside 'hunting down enemies'. "This next Agent should give you a
            more... intimate feeling when hunting down enemies. Of course, there
            is our theme-but the thought of giving away too much frightens me so
            I'll leave that out."

          <h2>Setting goals and expectations before RLCS 2022 SPRING: NA REGIONAL 3</h2>
          <p>
            In just 10 days, we go back to another Rocket League packed weekend.
            The RLCS 2021-22 Spring NA Regional Event 3 will be the final round
            for North America's biggest teams to earn those coveted Circuit Points.
            <br />
            NA's Rocket League scene has proven its dominance over its
            European counterparts after four NA teams placed top five at
            RLCS Winter Major 2022. G2 Esports, Spacestation Gaming,
            FaZe Clan, and Version1 are looking dominant this season.
            One final regional event will secure all of them a spot at
            the next Major. NRG and Envy are in this mix as well.

          <p>
            Fortnite has become its own platform to celebrate gaming and
            the devices that make it possible. Epic Games always introduces
            a new collaboration with consoles and other major gaming
            franchises. Now, Fortnite is again partnering with PlayStation
            to give players the ability to earn rewards through their Epic
            Games and PlayStation Network accounts.
            <br />
            The current campaign is called The Supply Llama Challenge
            and can reward players with new cosmetics. To qualify for
            this new challenge, players will need to sign up with their
            PlayStation account and Epic Games account by visiting the
            <a href="https://fortnite.playstation.com/" target="_blank">official link</a>.

          <h2>League of Legends patch 12.10 notes</h2>
          <p>
            League of Legends patch 12.10 is going to change the game forever.
            The so-called "durability update" is the biggest in history,
            with every champion and almost every item in the game affected
            as Riot fixes major issues with the game's pace: here's the full patch notes.
            <br />
            League of Legends patch 12.10 is arguably the largest update of the year
            - even bigger than all the preseason changes that came along in the off-season.
